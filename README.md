# Elite Data Slurps

  - Just want to create an simple script that will record locally:
    - the locations of the highest sell prices
    - the locations of the lowest buy prices 
  - for each commodity
  - by parsing the EDDN data packets.

Really basic (and probably wrong/incomplete) instructions:

get requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

run slurper:
`python3 slurper.py`
